            <h2>Ukraine migration trend from 2021-2024</h2>
            <p>In 2021, there could be observed the start of a migration wave and it was only the beginning and by February 2022, 
              what was a small wave became a tsunami, with millions of Ukrainian leaving their homeland, driven by an urgent need 
              for safety and stability, seeking refuge in foreign lands far from the turmoil engulfing their country. These charts 
              trace the journey from the subtle early signs in 2021 through to the explosive surge in migration witnessed in 2022, 
              capturing the stark reality of this dramatic period. As the data transitions into 2023 and the early months of 2024, 
              a noticable reduction in migration numbers can be observed. Nonetheless, it is critical to recognize that the migration 
              figures, despite their reduction, continue to exceed the levels recorded prior to the 2022 escalation. This persistently 
              elevated rate of displacement among Ukrainians indicates a continued.This line chart gives you an overview of the migration
              of Ukrainians over the past 3 years. However, we will give you one more thing to understand about the largest human migration in
              recent decades due to war.

          <h2>Migration from Ukraine in Europe territory</h2>
          <p>
            In this map, we aim to explain why the migration of Ukrainians to Europe surged significantly in late 2023 and early 2024
            . To begin, it's worth mentioning that the map features six colors, each corresponding to the number of people indicated 
            next to it. Our analysis starts in February 2022 when Russia initiated military operations in Ukraine. Over the past 
            two years, major Ukrainian cities have been severely impacted by the conflict, prompting European governments to 
            support Ukrainian emigration.

            Consequently, we developed this map to provide a clear visualization of the total number of Ukrainians who have migrated 
            to Europe by early 2024. According to the map, European countries have warmly welcomed Ukrainian refugees, with the 
            number reaching 8 million in the EU alone. Notably, Germany and Poland have received the largest numbers of Ukrainian 
            migrants, approximately 1.1 million and 0.9 million people, respectively. Interestingly, despite the ongoing war with 
            Ukraine, Russia hosts up to 1.2 million Ukrainian residents. Amid the conflict, many Ukrainians have sought safe havens.
            Even though there are a conflicts with Russia, some have opted to seek refuge in Russia due to cultural and linguistic 
            similarities, familial and social networks, and better economic conditions. Nevertheless, not everyone has chosen to 
            stay; many have fled to other countries or have chosen to remain within Ukraine.

          <h2>Ukraine IDP Demographic 2022/2024</h2>
          <p>The data of Ukraine's internally displaced persons (IDPs) reveals notable patterns between 2022 and 2024. 
            In the age-group graph, there's an overall downward trend, with the most significant decrease seen in the Adult 
            category, dropping from approximately 3.2 million to 1.7 million. This might suggest that individuals in this age 
            group are often the most able to move, finding opportunities to settle or relocate elsewhere.  Meanwhile, the modest 
            reductions in the numbers of the very young and the elderly imply that these demographics may face greater challenges in 
            relocating or have limited opportunities available to them.
          </br>
          </br>
            The gender data of Ukraine's IDPs indicates that from 2022 to 2024, the number of displaced individuals of both genders 
            has decreased. Specifically, for males, the number went down from approximately 2.4 million to 1.3 million. 
            and 3.2 million to 2.1 million for female. This uniform decline suggests a 
            common set of factors influencing displacement, regardless of gender, such as improved conditions and assistance 
            from humanitarian organizations. Since the war has continued for two years, support systems are likely 
            well-established, enabling displaced people to return or settle. The consistent pattern of reduction across both 
            genders provides a clearer picture of the displacement trends in Ukraine, reflecting a general improvement in the 
            situation of IDPs over the two years observed.</p>
